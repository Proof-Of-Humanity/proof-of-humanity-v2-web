Once staked, subscribe to notifications so you’ll be notified when you’re randomly selected to judge a case.\n\n The more PNK you stake, the higher your chances of being selected. But remember, jurors are expected to vote honestly and coherently based on the evidence. Those who do can earn arbitration fees and bonuses. Those who don’t will lose part of their stake.\n\n✅ Coherent Vote (Align with the majority) = 🤑 Earn arbitration fees + extra PNK\n❌ Incoherent Vote (Against the majority) = 😬 Lose some staked PNK\n⚖️ Fair rulings are rewarded & the system keeps jurors honest.',
